# ML-StartupProfit
This research forecasts startup earnings using machine learning models based on R&amp;D, administrative, and marketing costs. It consists of data preparation, model training (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR), and performance evaluation to choose the optimal model.
Objectives:
Earnings Prediction: Use machine learning to anticipate startup revenues based on input factors such as R&D, administrative, and marketing expenses.

Data Preparation: Gather, clean, and preprocess relevant data to ensure it is appropriate for training machine learning models.

Model Training: Use various regression models, such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression, to forecast startup revenue.

Performance Evaluation: Evaluate each trained model's performance using relevant metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Model Selection: Compare the performance of many models and choose the most accurate and dependable one for projecting startup revenues.
Objectives:
Earnings Prediction: Use machine learning to anticipate startup revenues based on input factors such as R&D, administrative, and marketing expenses.

Methodology: Collect data on startup revenues, R&D spending, administrative costs, and marketing expenses from credible sources or databases.
